Howdy!

I work on the Spring team.

When I'm not slinging code as a test-bitten script junky, I'm either shooting another [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/@SpringBootLearning) or playing pinball.

* I've written several software books including [Learning Spring Boot 3.0 3rd Edition](https://springbootlearning.com/book) and [Hacking with Spring Boot 2.3: Reactive Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086722L4L).
* I also began dabbling in the realm of speculative fiction with [Darklight](https://www.amazon.com/Darklight-Coming-Age-Fantasy-Book-ebook/dp/B07C99CNS8).

* Check out my Spring Boot videos at https://YouTube.com/@SpringBootLearning.
* Feel free to chat with me on Twitter [@springbootlearn](https://twitter.com/springbootlearn).

Please enjoy this video and get a glimpse of the daily life of a Spring developer!
