When I'm not slinging code as a test-bitten script junky on the Spring team, I'm either shooting another YouTube video or working on my next book.

I've written several software books including my latest: [Hacking with Spring Boot 2.3: Reactive Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086722L4L).

But I also began dabbling in the realm of speculative fiction with my debut novel, [Darklight](https://www.amazon.com/Darklight-Coming-Age-Fantasy-Book-ebook/dp/B07C99CNS8).

...and I haven't stopped!
