Howdy!

I work on the Spring team.

When I'm not slinging code as a test-bitten script junky, I'm either shooting another YouTube video or playing pinball.

* I've written several software books including [Hacking with Spring Boot 2.3: Reactive Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086722L4L).
* I also began dabbling in the realm of speculative fiction with [Darklight](https://www.amazon.com/Darklight-Coming-Age-Fantasy-Book-ebook/dp/B07C99CNS8).

I also like interacting with my peeps at the Nashville Java User Group.

Please enjoy this video and get a glimpse of the daily life of a Spring developer!
