Howdy!

I worked on the Spring team for over 13 years as the lead for Spring Data JPA and Spring Web Services.

* When I'm not slinging code as a test-bitten script junky, I'm probably shooting another [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/@ProCoderIO). 

* I've written several best-selling software books including [Learning Spring Boot 3.0 3rd Edition](https://springbootlearning.com/book) and [Hacking with Spring Boot 2.3: Reactive Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086722L4L).

* Grab my latest book, _12 Rules For Pro Coders_, while its still on pre-sale at [12rules.io](12rules.io)!
