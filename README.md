Howdy!

I worked on the Spring team for over 13 years as the lead for Spring Data JPA and Spring Web Services.

I've built mission critical system and battled midnight failures. I've released software used by millions aroubd the world.

* When I'm not slinging code as a test-bitten script junky, I'm probably shooting another [YouTube video](https://youtube.com/@ProCoderIO). 

* I've written several best-selling software books including [Learning Spring Boot 3.0 3rd Edition](https://springbootlearning.com/book) and [Hacking with Spring Boot 2.3: Reactive Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086722L4L).

* Grab my latest book, _12 Rules For Pro Coders_, while its still on pre-sale at [12rules.io](https://12rules.io)!

* Feel free to chat with me on Twitter [@gregturn](https://twitter.com/gregturn).

I'm open to work opportunities. Feel free to contact me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-l-turnquist. 

In the meantime, feel free to enjoy this video!
