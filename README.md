Howdy!

I am a technical content engineer at Cockroach Labs and LOVE helping people build bigger and better systems! I also worked on the Spring team for over 13 years and was the lead for Spring Data JPA and Spring Web Services. I've built mission critical system and battled midnight failures. I've released software used by millions around the world.
